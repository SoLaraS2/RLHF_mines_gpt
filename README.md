# RLHF_mines_gpt
Reinforcement learning through human feedback, fine tuning pre trained model to output logs.

Pip install dependencies, there are a whole lot.

You will likely need a hugging face account to run this, make sure to set that up before starting.

The outputs to the hugging face project right now are garbage, I do not know what is going wrong, but it is not logging what it needs to.
